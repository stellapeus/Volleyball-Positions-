    <h1>Different Positions</h1>
    <p>There are multiple different positions in the world of volleyball. One positon, being the "quarterback" of volleyball, is the setter.
    The setter is the person who places the ball just above the net for the hitter to spike. This requires the setter to use a special technique where the ball exits their hands quickly.</p>
